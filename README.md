javascript quizes/challenges, gathered from:
* [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Iulius90) (currently my favourite because it has a lot of quizes/challenges available for free, large comunity, you can compare your solutions to many others and the posibility to solve the challenges in multiple languages )
* [coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/profile/Iulius90)
* [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/savin_iulian90)

   //Most if not all of the solutions (by the time you're reading this) are written in ES6.
   //This are the sollutions that I could think of and are not by any means the best/most optimized solutions.
